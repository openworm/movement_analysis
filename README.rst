**movement\_validation** is a Python port of the Schafer Lab's `Worm
Tracker
2 <http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/wormtracker/index.php?action=analysis>`__
analysis software.

It can be used to process videos of *C. elegans* into statistics so the
behaviour of individual worms can be compared.

It is also the package used by the OpenWorm project to determine how
closely its simulated worm behaves like real worms. It was started as a
sub-project of the `OpenWorm project <https://github.com/openworm>`__.

It is only about 50% complete. Please see:
