Validate that the features calculations in movement_validation
match those of the original Matlab codebase, by comparing
calculated features with a saved copy of the file generated by 
the original Matlab code.

To run this code files should be obtained from:
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7to9gBdZEyGNWtWUElWVzVxc0E&usp=sharing

In addition the user_config.py file should be created in the 
movement_validation package based on the user_config_example.txt
