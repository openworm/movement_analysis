Schafer Lab
~~~~~~~~~~~

`The Schafer
Lab <http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/wschafer/>`__, at the `MRC
Laboratory of Molecular Biology <http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/>`__,
Cambridge, UK, developed the `Worm Analysis
Toolbox <http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/wormtracker/index.php?action=analysis>`__
to work with data from the `Worm Tracker 2.0
(WT2) <http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/wormtracker/>`__. The
movement\_validation package is a port of the last version of the Worm
Analysis Toolbox, version 1.3.4.

`Dr. Eviatar "Ev"
Yemini <https://sites.google.com/site/openarchitecture1/3-contributors-and-syntax/ev-yemini>`__,
for all the original Matlab code built as part of `the WormBehavior
database <http://wormbehavior.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/>`__, written as part of
his doctorate at the Schafer Lab. Without him this project would not
have been possible. His PhD thesis was partly based on his work creating
the analysis package we ported to form the basis of the package.

`Dr. Tadas Jucikas <https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjucikas>`__,
post-doctoral scholar at the Schafer Lab, for co-authoring the Worm
Tracker 2.0 analysis package with Ev.

`Dr. William "Bill"
Schafer <http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/n-to-s/william-schafer/>`__,
Schafer Lab eponym, for allowing us to use and adapt Ev's code.

`Dr. André
Brown <http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/wschafer/people2.html>`__,
post-doctoral scholar at the Schafer Lab, for contributions to the
original Matlab code and for his work on behavioural motifs, which we
hope to add.

`Barry
Bentley <http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?bb421>`__,
PhD student at the Schafer Lab, for his ongoing support of our use of
their code.

`Laura
Grundy <http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/n-to-s/william-schafer/>`__,
lab assistant at the Schafer Lab, for filming many hundreds of hours of
C. elegans videos.
