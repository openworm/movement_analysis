Further Information on the original Schafer Lab Work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dr. Yemini at the [Schafer
Lab]((http://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/wschafer/) at Cambridge
University has taken thousands of hours of C. elegans videos (`here is
an example <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FAiSgl55p0>`__), using their
proprietary hardware/software package called Worm Tracker 2 (WT2). The
videos are processed by the WT2 software's image processing to capture
the worm's skeleton and contour over time, in 15-minute segments. This
video metadata is stored in hundreds of experiment files available on
their FTP server. [2]

The structure of the HDF5 files is described at a high level starting on
page 183 of Dr. Eviatar Yemeniâ€™s 2011 thesis [3] or in the supplemental
material of his 2013 Nature Methods paper [5]. In [2], for example,
there are 23135 frames describing 899.9515 seconds of worm movement (900
seconds is 15 minutes)

Technical descriptions of the features calculated are `available in
hyperlinked
form <https://github.com/openworm/movement_validation/blob/master/documentation/Yemini%20Supplemental%20Data/Schafer%20Lab%20Feature%20Descriptions.md>`__,
in documents adapted from the original Schafer Lab Supplemental
Documentation to [4].
